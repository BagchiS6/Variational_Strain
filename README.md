Analysis for this work was perfomred using standard softwares such as MD code LAMMPS and Ovito-API for post-processing. As no such custom built code/software was developed as part of this work, we provide sample analysis notebooks which showcases full history of various results in discussed in the main manuscript. 

1. Constant stress ensemble prediction can be found at compression_2%, tension_2%. 
2. An example of the variational entropy estimation approach can be found in entropy_computation_examples
3. Associated notebooks and all relelvant data presented in the main text can be found in Main_Figure_Data (directory labels might not directly reflect the figure numbers)
