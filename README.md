Analysis for this work was performed using standard softwares such as open source MD code LAMMPS and scripts using Ovito-API for post-processing. We provide "smaller-scale sample analysis" notebooks which showcases full history of various results as discussed in the main manuscript. 

1. Constant stress ensemble prediction can be found at compression_2%, tension_2%. 
2. Associated notebooks and all relelvant data presented in the main text can be found in Main_Figure_Data (directory labels might not directly reflect the figure numbers)
